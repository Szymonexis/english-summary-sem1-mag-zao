## Given the text below. Associate words with their definition.

The Android SDK has a base class for each type of component (Activity, Service, Receiver, and Provider), with callback methods that are invoked at various points in the life cycle of the associated component. Each component has a life cycle. Each component of an application is defined by

extending one of the base classes, and overriding the methods in that class. In particular:

1. The Activity class has methods that are run when activity is created, or activity calls some other activity, or returns to the activity.
2. The Service class has methods that are run when the service is started, or some component binds to this service or even combination of both.
3. The Receiver class has a method that is run when a message is sent to this receiver.
4. The Provider class has methods to delete, query and update the data stored by this provider.

<div class="letter-ol">
  <ol>
    <li>
      ________ – in order to use its functionality, you need to invoke its start method. It has the ability to link itself with other components.
    </li>
    <li>
      ________ – its main purpose is to store, read, modify and destroy data.
    </li>
    <li>
      ________ – it invokes its methods in the moment of instantiation, during which other objects of this class can be referenced as well.
    </li>
    <li>
      ________ – in order to invoke its method we have to send some information to it.

In the advancing world of **\_\_\_\_**, Mobile applications are a rapidly growing segment of the global mobile market. Mobile applications are evolving at a **\_\_\_\_** to give users a rich and fast user experience. In this paper, Android mobile platform for the mobile application development, **\_\_\_\_** layered approach and the details of security information for Android is discussed. Google released Android which is an **\_\_\_\_** open-source mobile phone operating system with Linux-based platform. It consists of the operating system, middleware, and user interface and application software. Certainly, Android is about to become the most widely used OS on mobile phones, but with Android comes a security **\_\_\_\_** that few users take into account. On Android Market, where you can download thousands of applications for Android, anyone can upload their programs without having to submit them to careful security checks. This makes Android a prime target for computer criminals. In this paper, we discuss a layered approach for android application development where we can develop application which **\_\_\_\_** data from the server. Also an Android Application Sandbox (AASandbox) which is able to perform both static and dynamic **\_\_\_\_** on Android programs to automatically detect **\_\_\_\_** applications is also discussed.

## Given the text below. Assert if the sentences are true or false

### SECURITY ISSUES RELATED TO ANDROID PLATFORM

The integrity of the Android platform is maintained through a variety of security measures.

### A. Applications as Operating System User

Each and every application is a user using the operating system. When an application is installed, the operating system creates a new user profile associated with the application. Each application runs as a different user, with its own private files on the file system, a user ID, and a secure operating environment. The application executes in its own process with its own instance of the Dalvik VM and under its own user ID on the operating system.

### B. Explicitly Defined Application Permission

When an Android requires explicitly defined application permissions in the manifest file. To access shared resources on the system, Android applications register for the specific privileges they require. While developing the application required permissions should be specified in Android manifest file. For example if the phone vibration functionality is required then it must be specified in the android manifest file. While installing the application it shows the list of resources that the application is going to access. Some of these privileges enable the application to use phone functionality to make calls, access the network, and control the camera and

other hardware sensors. Applications also require permission to access shared data containing private and personal information such as user preferences, user’s location, and contact information. Applications might also enforce their own permissions by declaring them for other applications to

use. The application can declare any number of different permission types, such as read-only or read-write permissions, for finer control over the application.

### C. Limited Ad-Hoc Permissions

Content providers might want to provide some on-the-fly permissions to other applications for specific information they want to share openly. This is done using ad-hoc granting and

revoking of access to specific resources using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). URIs points to specific data

assets on the system, such as MediaStore, Contacts, CallLog etc. Here is an example of a URI that provides the phone numbers of all contacts: content://contacts/phones.

### D. Application Signing for Trust Relationships

All Android applications packages are signed with a certificate, so users know that the application is authentic. The private key for the certificate is held by the developer. This helps establish a trust relationship between the developer and the user. It also allows the developer to control which applications can grant access to one another on the system. No certificate authority is necessary; self-signed certificates are acceptable.

1. Each instance of the application runs as separate process
2. Each application is using one system-wide instance of Dalvik VM
3. Application can access any resource that system provides
4. Application can define its own permissions, which grant access to its resources for other applications to use
5. Application can not grant permissions temporarily
6. User can install application that does not have certificate
7. Android operation system have to grant the access to user’s location
